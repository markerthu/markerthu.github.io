We propose CESAR, an online RL framework (GRPO) with multi-faceted reasoning process rewards incentivizing consistency, structured analytical patterns, and calibrated depth. Resolves test-time inverse scaling in Audio LLMs; achieves SOTA on MMAU Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio.
