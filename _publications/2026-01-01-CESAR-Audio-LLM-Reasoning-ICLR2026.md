We propose CESAR, an online RL framework using GRPO with multi-faceted reasoning process rewards that incentivize consistency, structured reasoning, and calibrated depth. CESAR resolves test-time inverse scaling in Audio LLMs and achieves SOTA on MMAU Test-mini, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio.
