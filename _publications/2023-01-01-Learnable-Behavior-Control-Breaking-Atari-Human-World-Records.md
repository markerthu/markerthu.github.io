We propose LBC (Learnable Behavior Control), a unified framework enabling significantly enlarged behavior selection space via a hybrid behavior mapping. Our agents achieved 10077.52% mean human normalized score and surpassed 24 human world records within 1B training frames, demonstrating SOTA performance with exceptional sample efficiency.
