We introduce ORW-CFM-W2, a self-evolving RLHF framework enabling flow matching models to continuously optimize through online reward feedback without relying on human-collected datasets. We derive a tractable Wasserstein-2 bound providing the first theoretical guarantee for collapse-free policy evolution.
