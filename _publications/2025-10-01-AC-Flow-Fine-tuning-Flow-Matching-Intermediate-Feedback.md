We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic framework for fine-tuning flow matching generative models with intermediate feedback. Key innovations include reward shaping for stable intermediate value learning, a dual-stability mechanism combining advantage clipping with critic warm-up, and a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme with Wasserstein regularization. Achieves SOTA text-to-image alignment on Stable Diffusion 3 without compromising diversity or stability.
