We propose ADRPO, which dynamically adjusts divergence regularization strength based on advantage estimates — reducing regularization for high-value samples while applying stronger constraints to poor samples. Enables a 2B SD3 model to surpass 4.8B/12B models; also generalizes to LLMs and multimodal reasoning.
