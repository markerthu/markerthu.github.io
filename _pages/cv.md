## Research Interest

- **Primary:** Stable and autonomous RL post-training for large generative models, spanning flow/diffusion models and multi-modal reasoning LLMs. Key focus on progressively reducing human intervention in the post-training pipeline.
- **Secondary:** Scalable and stable post-training methods that address critical challenges in RL-based fine-tuning: collapse-free training, adaptive exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and effective test-time scaling.
