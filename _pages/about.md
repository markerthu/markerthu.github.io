## Hello, I'm Jiajun Fan

> "The goal is not just to build better AI, but to understand intelligence itself"

I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working on making AI systems that can learn and improve continuously. My research focuses on making AI systems more efficient, reliable, and capable of learning from human feedback.

## Research Interests

> "The best way to predict the future is to create it"

My work focuses on three main areas:
- **Making AI Learn Better**: Creating systems that can learn continuously while staying reliable
- **Efficient Learning**: Getting AI to learn from less data while performing better
- **Practical AI**: Building AI systems that work well in real-world situations

## Key Achievements 

- Developed methods that learn 500x faster than previous approaches
- Published research ranked in top 5 out of 4176 papers at ICLR 2023
- Broke 24 human world records in classic Atari games
- Created 9 new patented technologies in AI learning systems
- Consistently ranked in top 1% throughout academic career

## Recent News

> "Progress lies not in enhancing what is, but in advancing toward what will be"

- New research on improving AI learning accepted at ICLR 2025
- Looking for Summer 2025 internship opportunities in AI development
- Selected as reviewer for top AI conferences (ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS)
- Leading new projects in AI learning systems at UIUC

## Research Experience

I've had the privilege of working at leading institutions worldwide:
- **UIUC**: Working on next-generation AI learning systems
- **Mila Institute**: Developing better robot control systems
- **Tsinghua University**: Created new ways for AI to learn from experience

## Publications and Impact

> "The measure of intelligence is the ability to change"

My research has been published in top venues like ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS, focusing on:
- Making AI systems that learn more efficiently
- Developing more reliable learning methods
- Creating AI that can improve itself over time
