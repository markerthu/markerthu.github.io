As a Ph.D. student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), I am profoundly interested in the development of advanced intelligent agents capable of human-level cognition, and even attaining superhuman levels of intelligence. I am convinced that the integration of machine learning and robotics holds immense potential for transforming human life and reshaping our future in unprecedented ways.


## Research Interest

I am actively exploring the fascinating area of Reinforcement Learning, which I believe plays a crucial role in achieving Artificial General Intelligence. My current focus is on improving controlable reinforcement learning and enhancing the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms. While I'm still in the early stages of my academic journey, my dedication to this field is strong, and I aim to build my entire professional career around it.

If my research aligns with your interests and academic pursuits, I welcome you to reach out to me via [email](mailto:jiajunfanthu@gmail.com).

## Background


I am currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program in Computer Science at  University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
