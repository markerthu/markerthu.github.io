I'm Jiajun Fan, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working at the intersection of reinforcement learning theory and large-scale AI systems. My research focuses on developing self-evolving AI systems that can learn continuously from human feedback while maintaining reliability and sample efficiency.

> Currently seeking research internship opportunities for Summer 2025.

## Research Focus

My work addresses fundamental challenges in AI development through three key areas:

- **Self-Evolving AI Systems**: Creating AI systems that can continuously improve through online learning while preventing collapse and maintaining diversity
- **Data-Efficient Learning**: Developing algorithms that achieve superhuman performance with orders of magnitude less data
- **Theoretical Foundations**: Building rigorous mathematical frameworks for understanding and improving AI learning processes

## Research Highlights

- **Flow Matching with Wasserstein Regularization**: Developed the first theoretically-grounded framework for continuous model evolution with provable diversity guarantees, reducing data requirements by orders of magnitude [ICLR 2025]
- **Learnable Behavior Control**: Created a unified framework that broke 24 Atari world records while using 500x less data than previous methods [ICLR 2023 Oral, top 5/4176]
- **Generalized Data Distribution**: Pioneered a new reinforcement learning paradigm that achieves state-of-the-art performance through optimized data distribution [ICML 2022]

## Latest News

- [2025-02] New paper on self-evolving Flow Matching Generative Models accepted to ICLR 2025
- [2025-01] Selected as reviewer for ICML 2025, ICLR 2025, and NeurIPS 2024
- [2024-08] Started research on collapse-free self-evolution at UIUC
