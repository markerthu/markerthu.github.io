I'm Jiajun Fan, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working at the intersection of reinforcement learning theory and large-scale AI systems. My research focuses on developing self-evolving AI systems that can learn continuously from human feedback while maintaining reliability and sample efficiency.

## Selected Publications

My research has been published at top venues including ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS. Recent highlights:

1. **Online Reward-Weighted Fine-Tuning of Flow Matching with Wasserstein Regularization**  
   *ICLR 2025*  
   For the first time, we proposed a framework for online post-training with RL for the flow matching model from both theoretical and practical perspectives (**Collapse-Free, No Human-Collected Data Needed, Self-Evolution by Agent itself**).

2. **Learnable Behavior Control: Breaking Atari Human World Records**  
   *ICLR 2023 (Oral Presentation)*  
   We demonstrate for the first time the dramatic advantages of MoE in RL and break 24 human world records (**100x cost reduction, Stable Self-Evolution of MoE**)

3. **Generalized Data Distribution Iteration**  
   *ICML 2022*  
   For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the importance of data optimization in RL. (**Theoretical guarantee for continuous and stable self-evolution of MoE and single agent**)


## Research Focus

My work addresses fundamental challenges in AI development through three key areas:

- **Self-Evolving AI Systems**: Creating AI systems that can continuously improve through online learning while preventing collapse and maintaining diversity
- **Data-Efficient Learning**: Developing algorithms that achieve superhuman performance with orders of magnitude less data
- **Theoretical Foundations**: Building rigorous mathematical frameworks for understanding and improving AI learning processes

## Research Highlights

- **Flow Matching with Wasserstein Regularization**: Developed the first theoretically-grounded framework for continuous model evolution with provable diversity guarantees, reducing data requirements by orders of magnitude [ICLR 2025]
- **Learnable Behavior Control**: Created a unified framework that broke 24 Atari world records while using 500x less data than previous methods [ICLR 2023 Oral, top 5/4176]
- **Generalized Data Distribution**: Pioneered a new reinforcement learning paradigm that achieves state-of-the-art performance through optimized data distribution [ICML 2022]
